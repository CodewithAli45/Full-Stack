/*

Closures: A closure is a combination of function and its lexcial environment within which function is declared.
The closure is created when a child functions to keep the environment of the parentâ€™s scope even after the parentâ€™s function has already executed. The Closure is a locally declared variable related to a function. The closure will provide better control over the code when using them.
